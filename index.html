      <h2>Water Project One</h2>
      <p> There's a smart way to end the water crisis.
      People around the Democratic Republic of Congo could get access to safe water in their homes with the help of volunteers and donations.</p>
      <p>Fast Facts:</p>
      <p>World Water Crisis</p>
      <p>An Incredible Fact:</p>
      <p>More people die from lack of clean drinking water than from all forms of violence combined... including war!</p>
      <p><em>(United Nations)</em></p>

      <p>Illness & Disease</p>
      <p>Fully half of the hospital beds worldwide are occupied by someone suffering from a water-related illness.</p>
      <p>80% of all diseases are waterborne.</p>
      <p><em>(World Health Organization)</em></p>

      <p>* At present, 2.4 billion people have inadequate access to sanitation... with nearly a billion people practicing open defecation.</p>
      <p>* About 750 million people have no access to safe drinking water. This is a travesty!</p>
      <p>* Diarrhea is the leading cause of death for children under 5 worldwide.</p>
      <p>Naturally, these figures are changing daily, and they have improved since we started doing this work (it was over 1.2 billion without clean water then). This is encouraging, and it shows that we can actually solve this problem with the means at hand. And yet, there is a lot of work still to be done. With around 80 million displaced people at any given moment (more than at any time in history)... and with massive, seemingly-endless conflicts raging in many places... and knowing that no census style infrastructure exists in much of the world... exact numbers of people suffering are fairly well impossible. What is not impossible, is alleviating the needless suffering.Solving water issues is not difficult, doesn't take any new technology, and is not expensive... it just takes desire.</p>
